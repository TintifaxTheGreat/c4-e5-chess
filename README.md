# C4-E5 Chess

C4-E5 Chess is a [UCI](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) compatible chess engine based on the move generator in crate [Chess](https://docs.rs/chess/latest/chess/).

These features are provided:

- Iterative depthening (parallelised)
- Late move pruning
- Principal variant search
- Transposition table

At the time being, the focus was on simplicity and certainly there is a lot of potential in improvments in terms of playing strength.
